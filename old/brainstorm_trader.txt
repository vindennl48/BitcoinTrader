Write separate program to collect data from cryptowat.ch or poloniex and store 
in text file.  Lets keep this consistent.

Use 80% of dataset for breeding and 20% for testing.

To load data into the brain, we should:
  - input high/low open/close prices for each time block
  - output a 1 or a 0 for buy or sell.

  To get output
  - if there is a 1 output, buy and hold on to the buy
  - if there is a 0 output, sell and stay out

  To score fitness
  - Each Agent gets $100.00 to start with.
   - If the Agent ever goes below $10.00, then they stop processing data
     +  and are scored from that point.
     - At the end of processing, The fitness level is scored based on profit.
     +  So if the agent ends with $50.00, he receives a score of 25%.  If he ends
       +  with $100.00 (what he starts with), he receives 50%, $200.00, receives 100%
       +  This keeps going until we decide to stop the program.  We are looking for
         +  Consistency.
